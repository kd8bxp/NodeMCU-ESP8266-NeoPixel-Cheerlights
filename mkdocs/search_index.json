People build various projects for the light show. Generally it's around Christmas time, but really Cheerlights spread the cheer all year long.\n\n\nThis is the beginning of a Halloween cheerlight project.\nThe final project will make spooky noises when the colors change.\nAnd put in either a pumpkin or a skull (not sure yet).\n(This could be easy to change to X-Mas music for Christmas holiday.)\n\n\nIn the past I've done projects using the ethernet shield for the Arduino UNO, so I was limited to where the projects could be put.\nNot finding a ESP8266 sketch that I could get to work correctly, I set out to make my own. Luckily I found making a few changes to my ethernet sketches, was easy to do.\nFor more Info on \nCheerlights\n.\nTo see pictures and fritzing, click on pictures above.\n\n\nI used a Neopixel 16 pixel ring, a nodemcu v.9 board. Arduino IDE 1.6.10 for Linux 64bit, the following libraries are required:\n\n\nESP8266WiFi.h - This library gets installed when you add the ESP8266 boards to the Arduino IDE. Information and Setup can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nAdafruit_NeoPixel.h - \nFound Here\n\n This may or may not be the best library for this project, but it is one that I've used in the past, and I understand how to make it work.\n\n\nFinally - The TimedAction.h library - \nFound Here\n. Note: I had to make a change to this library to get it to work with the new IDE. That is beyond the scope of this documentation.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\nNodeMCU has limited power on it's 5v line - while it looks like more than one LED is on - truelly only 1 LED is on at a time.\nI've also dimmed the brightness down.\nI've read that it is capable of driving 6 to 8 of the LEDs at one time, but why risk it.\n\n\nIt should also be noted that the NodeMCU boards pin maps are a bit weird. Pin 2 in the IDE is really D4 on the board.  IF you wanted to use \"Pin 2\" you'd need to say \"D2\" in the IDE then it would be maped to pin4 of the esp8266. Google it, there are a number of things about it.",
